  I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics at the department of Economics, Management and Statistics (DEMS) of University of Milano-Bicocca ([ECOSTAT - XXXVI Cycle](https://www.dems.unimib.it/en/research/phd-programme)). I currently live in Turin, Italy.

  I am also a Data Scientist at Intesa Sanpaolo and my job is the development of projects that, through machine learning algorithms and other quantitative methods, can lead to business development.

  Whether at work or University, I mainly use Python and R, but I am open to a variety of programming languages, which I used to cover the various phases of a data science project (data wrangling, modelling, programming and visualizing).

  My complete curriculum vitae is available at [this link](https://github.com/riccardocogo93/riccardocogo93.github.io/tree/master/files/CV_COGO.pdf).

          <mark>Thesis Title</mark>: Study of Some Overdetermined Elliptic Problems (advisor: prof. [Paolo Caldiroli](https://www.matematica.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Alias?paolo.caldiroli#tab-profilo)).

          In the context of elliptical problems with data on the edge, the thesis deals with overdetermined problems, i.e. those problems defined by a PDE defined on a domain and by two boundary conditions,
          a Dirichlet and a Neumann. The thesis considers some examples of overdetermined elliptic problems and assuming that they admit a solution,
          it makes an attempt to study the geometric and topological properties of its domain.
